          Made by Reagan of IfThenCreate. Thanks to COVID, experts with real
          studies recommend you stay away from public spaces, so we made a
          stand-in for your favorite cafe. We recommend Chrome for the best
          experience.

        <p>
          Earth.fm is a non-profit, free repository of 800+ pure, immersive
          natural soundscapes from around the world. Based on empirical evidence
          as well as numerous recent studies from all over the world, listening
          to natural soundscapes (particularly mindful listening) has a great
          positive impact on our wellbeing, and potentially on our respect for
          nature. However, these soundscapes are increasingly scarce as we
          humans continue to destroy the natural ecosystems which produce them.

          The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web founded
          by the Internet Archive, an American nonprofit organization based in
          San Francisco, California. It allows the user to go "back in time" to
          see how websites looked in the past.

        <p>
          Hickman was inspired to create Kid Pix after watching his son Ben
          struggle with MacPaint, and thus the main idea behind its development
          was to create a drawing program that would be very simple to use.
