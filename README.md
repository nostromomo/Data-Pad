This project was inspired by a lot of retro sci-fi that I love, Alien and 2001 A Space Odyssey to name a couple.
I want to hone the artistry of it a bit more, as it's quite plain and basic at the moment but my goal was to capture the analog
aesthetic of 90's technology. The click sound on the one button is a nod to this as well.

The home page is a data pad, with buttons leading to various pages within my website. 
Such as:
- writing portfolio
- link page with websites I like
- pictures of my cat (work in progress, maybe not everyone deserves to see her)
- my private museum (my favorite things, gathered together)
- API page

There are four inactive buttons, with the attribute 
```class="inactive"```
that highlight red rather than green to indicate their uselessness.
These pages are intended for:'
- nothing, simply click and hear a clicky noise. isn't it fun?
- quiz written by me, very accurate and true
- contact info page
- ðŸ¤·

The most distinctive part of this website (to me) is the hover aspect, which gives you information about the link you are about to follow.
This is buggy on the first button once the page reaches a certain small size, indicating that it will not work on mobile. 
This is fine, since the entire idea of "hover" doesn't even work on mobile anyways. But it is still annoying.
